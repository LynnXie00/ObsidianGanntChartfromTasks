# ObsidianGanntChartfromTasks
If you use obsidian tasks and dataview, this piece of codeblock will generate mermaid chart automatically

Make sure when you enter the dates in Obsidian tasks, enter in YYYY-MM-DD format.

You may change the  path of your project folder at the end of the code. My current path is "00 Life/Project Folder/Research"
